HERE IS MY PLAN:
My planned solution to this case is to make a savings app which should (if it was real) be integrated with your personal bank. In this app you can set a savings goal and unlock different stages off that goal during the way. The example i will use for this case is saving for a car, and would look something like this:

User chooses to save for a BWM costing 800 000 NOK, and then deposits 10K NOK into this account to start off. 
- Since its a car, the progress should be displayed as a progress bar where the progress icon is a bicycle, and the given car is the end. 
- When the user reaches for example 50K NOK the icon should change to another car which is within this price range (for example a used Suzuki Swift 2009 model). This makes the user aware that he/she can now "cash out" and buy this car instead if the user wants to.
